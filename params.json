My aim is to re implement this game so that it can be used to build native implementations of the game on any of the chosen target platforms.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to build my own version of the game is to get a game into the Play store that does not show annoying ads. It is simple enough game without any significant server side requirements, so asking money for this feels kind of unfair.\r\n\r\n## Ceylon language\r\n\r\nSo I make this implementation of the game in [Ceylon language](http://ceylon-lang.org). \r\n\r\nFirstly to make something not completely trivial in this beautiful language.\r\n\r\nSecondly, to demonstrate how you can use Ceylon to write an app that has (at least) three distinct UI versions based off the same source files:\r\n* _HTML + JavaScript_ version to be played on the browser\r\n* _JavaFX on JVM_ version to be played on the desktop\r\n* _Android on Dalvik_ version for mobile devices\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
