<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The project is currently in progress. The basic game engine is implemented, but there is no UI at the moment.</p>

<a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h2>

<p>As I've played many variations of this game on mobile platforms, I've become increasingly frustrated by the dismal energy performance of most variants -- Almost all variants I've played on Android eat battery like it was candy and heat up the phone in my hand to the point it is painful...</p>

<p>I suspect the reason for this is that all of these games are built on the same base of HTML + JavaScript, which requires the full power of browser VM between the device and the game implementation. My aim is to re implement this game so that it can be used to build native implementations of the game on any of the chosen target platforms.</p>

<p>Another reason to build my own version of the game is to get a game into the Play store that does not show annoying ads. It is simple enough game without any significant server side requirements, so asking money for this feels kind of unfair.</p>

<h2>
<a id="ceylon-language" class="anchor" href="#ceylon-language" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ceylon language</h2>

<p>So I make this implementation of the game in <a href="http://ceylon-lang.org">Ceylon language</a>. </p>

<p>Firstly to make something not completely trivial in this beautiful language.</p>

<p>Secondly, to demonstrate how you can use Ceylon to write an app that has (at least) three distinct UI versions based off the same source files:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>HTML + JavaScript</em> version to be played on the browser</li>
<li>
<em>JavaFX on JVM</em> version to be played on the desktop</li>
<li>
<em>Android on Dalvik</em> version for mobile devices</li>
</ul>
